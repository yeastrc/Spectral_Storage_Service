#  For requests that send the scan filename with path
#     restrict the path to start with one of these values.
#  If not configured with a value, 
#     all requests with scan filename and path will be rejected 
#     with the appropriate flag in the response.
#  The 'scan filename with path' string is turned into a Java File object
#     and then 'getCanonicalPath()' is called on it to resolve all 
#     path redirection like '../'.  
#     Also 'getCanonicalPath()' follows all symlinks to the actual file.
#     So the start of the path to the actual file is what has to be specified here.
